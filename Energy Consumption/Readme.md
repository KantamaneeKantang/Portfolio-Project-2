# Data Exploration in Energy Project

To make sure that everyone in the world has access to clean and safe energy, we need to understand energy consumption and its impacts around 
the world today and how this has changed over time. In this project, we will explore the world energy consumption with highlighting on Thailand 
and compare some data with the electricity accessing dataset.

A detailed description of the dataset of energy can be found on 
[Our World in data's website](https://ourworldindata.org/energy), and [electricity accessing](https://ourworldindata.org/number-without-electricity), 
but to summarize, the dataset has the variables following file named code book.xlsx.

The project is explored by SQL and then visualized by a dashboard in Power BI
